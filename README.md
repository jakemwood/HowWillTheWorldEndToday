How Will The World End Today
=======================

This is my final creative project for RELS 1260 (Apocalypticism in Film) at Northeastern.  It scrapes the latest news stories to "predict" how the world would end today

## How it Works

1. Scrape news stories off the interwebs
2. Scan for keywords related to apocalyptic themes (like ZOMBIES or ALIENS or UFO or NSA TAKEOVER)
3. Add up the total hits on these keywords.
4. Present using Google Charts.
